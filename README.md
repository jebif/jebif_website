# New_JeBiF

## Introduction
The goal of this repo is to create the structure of the JeBiF website, previously made with WordPress.
Depending on external circumstances, the others aspects of the website related to the elections will be added.

## Structure
This website is made with 7 categories in mind (L'association,  Evènements, Bioinformatique, Vulgarisation, Liens utiles, Nous rejoindre, and Contact). Each category has differents sub-categories. In addition, there is also a home page (Accueil).

Article is a class made to write articles, one for each category and subcategory (but it is designed to be able to present more). Only the home page (Accueil) has more articles, which could be considered "News".

Each page (Accueil, Category and SubCategory) present a Navigation bar (nav.html) to navigate in the website, and a side bar (side.html) to present different informations (next events, social medias, useful link, irc, recent articles, RSS and the Licence). Under the navbar is the banner of the website.

## Miscellaneous
Made by Alexandre Lerévérend: ask for any question.
